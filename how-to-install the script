To add a bookmark in Google Chrome that runs a JavaScript function, you'll be creating what's often referred to as a "bookmarklet." 
These are handy for automating frequent tasks or enhancing your browsing experience. 
Here's how to do it:

Open Chrome: Launch your Google Chrome browser.
Show the Bookmarks Bar: If your bookmarks bar isn't already visible, you can show it by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B on Windows or Command+Shift+B on macOS. Alternatively, you can click on the three vertical dots in the top right corner of the browser, go to "Bookmarks," and then select "Show bookmarks bar."

Add a Bookmark: You can add a bookmark in a few ways, but here's an easy one:

Right-click on the bookmarks bar.
Choose "Add page..." from the context menu.
Edit the Bookmark Details:

In the "Name" field, enter a descriptive name for your bookmarklet. This is what will appear on your bookmarks bar.
In the "URL" field, paste the LinkedInPost Export script. Ensure it starts with javascript: (this is crucial for the browser to recognize it as a script). For example, your script should look something like this: javascript:(function()%7Bfunction sc... (continue with your actual code).
Save the Bookmarklet: Click "Save." The bookmarklet will now appear on your bookmarks bar.

Using Your Bookmarklet: Whenever you want to run the script, simply click on its name on your bookmarks bar. The JavaScript will execute on the current page you're viewing.
